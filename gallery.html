			<img src = "images/basketball.jpeg" alt = "Kids playing basketball in gym"/>
			<p>Our volunteers and the boys of Christ Child Society were able to bond and play basketball, soccer, have push-up contests, and play volleyball!</p>
			<img src = "images/campustour.jpeg" alt = "Group posing in classroom" />
			<p>The older kids wanted to see what the University of Michigan campus looked like, so we organized a little tour for them! Of course, we showed them all the cool spots and took them out for lunch after. </p>
			<img src = "images/pumkinpatch.jpeg" alt = "Boys and volunteers at a pumkin patch"/>
			<p> Our SUNNY members took the kids out to have a little fun at the Apple Orchard! We went on hay rides and picked out the best pumpkins! </p>
			<img src = "images/hayride.jpeg" alt = "Volunteers riding in the wagon">
			<p>The annual hay ride at Wiard's Orchards with a Trunk-Or-Treat afterwards. </p>
			<img src = "images/iceskating.jpg" alt = "3 boys sitting in front of christmas tree"/>
			<p> Some of the boys at an ice skating event hosted by SUNNY at Campus Martius in Detroit. We also walked around the square and paid a visit to Santa!</p>
			<img src = "images/christmasgifts.JPG" alt = "Wrapped christmas gifts scattered on the table"/>
			<p>Every holiday season SUNNY members fulfill the children's christmas wish lists and deliver the wrapped gifts to the homes. </p> 
			<img src = "images/speakerseries.jpeg" alt = "Sunny members gathered in classroom listening to 2 speakers"/>
			<p>Our SUNNY members attending a  Speaker Series, in which foster care professionals come to speak about their experiences and raise awareness about the struggles that foster children face.</p> 
			<img src = "images/bakesale.jpeg" alt = "2 members at a table selling various baked goods"/>
			<p> Baked goods are much sweeter when proceeds are for a great cause. University of Michigan Sunny volunteers aim to raise money and awareness by selling items in Angel Hall. </p>
			<img src = "images/historicalmuseum.jpeg" alt = "Group of boys walking through the museum"/>
			<p> The children of Christ Child Society and our volunteers enjoyed a trip to the Detroit Historical Museum in honor of Black History Month! We made crafts, looked at local Detroit vendors, and toured the museum.</p>

			<p> One of the first events SUNNY ever hosted - building robots with the children at Christ Child! </p>
